## MA Linguistics, McGill University

### I am a MA student at the McGill University Department of Linguistics. I have a keen interest in statistics, especially as applied to social and political contexts, and data science more broadly. I also like table-top games and Olympic weightlifting, 

#### I am currently working with Professor Michael Wagner on the structural characteristics of ambiguous causal adjuncts in English. In addition I am pursuing projects on the morphosyntax of Lithuanian, as well as a corpus analysis project on class-based biases in media and online forums.
